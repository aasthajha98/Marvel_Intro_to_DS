Created by Aastha Jha.

This jupyter notebook is an introduction to data science in python meant to give students a flavor of how python tools such as pandas and numpy can be used to conduct data analysis. 
We use a Kaggle dataset with data on Marvel characters and their characteristics to conduct this exercise. 

In this exercise we explore the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
We explore data cleaning, analysis and then examples of data visualization.
